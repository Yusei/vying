class Board::Infinite < Board

  attr_reader :padding, :cell_orientation

  prototype

  # Initializes a shapeless, infinite board.  This is accomplished by setting
  # up a Board with some width and height and then expanding it automatically
  # as necessary.  Unlike most boards, the infinite board is centered around
  # (0,0) and will include negative x and y coordinates.  This is so resizing
  # doesn't change the coordinate for any of the pieces already on the board.
  #
  # Board.occupied will contain only empty coordinates within the current 
  # bounds of the board.  Say the board extends from (-10, -5) in one corner
  # to (5, 10) in the other corner.  If board[1,1] is nil, it will be included
  # in board.occupied[nil].  If board[-11,-11] is nil (obviously, or we would
  # have resized the bounds to include it), it will not be present in 
  # board.occupied[nil].  If the board is subsequently resized by placing a
  # piece at board[-12,-12], the board[-11,-11] would be added automatically
  # to board.occupied[nil].
  #
  # When the board is resized, some padding of empty cells will be placed
  # around any occupied cells.  This is done for the benefit of methods like
  # Coords#neighbors and the Frontier plugin.  The default padding is only
  # 1 empty cell.
  #
  # NOTE:  You don't have to call Board::Infinite.new directly, you can use
  #        the convenience method Board.infinite.
  #
  # Takes an optional min_width, min_height pair.  Also accepts the following
  # parameters: 
  #
  #   :cell_shape  -  Valid values include [:square, :hexagon, :triangle].
  #                   The default is :square.
  #   :directions  -  Some subset of [:n, :e, :w, :s, :ne, :nw, :se, :sw].
  #                   This value represents cell connectivity, and effects
  #                   the results of methods like Coords#neighbors.  Only valid
  #                   if :cell_shape is :square.  The default is the full set 
  #                   of 8 directions.  If :cell_shape is :triangle, the
  #                   connectivity directions will vary for each cell.  See
  #                   Board#directions.  If :cell_shape is :hexagon, use the
  #                   :cell_orientation parameter to change the directions.
  #
  #   :cell_orientation - Valid values include [:horizontal, :vertical].
  #                       This is used to set the connectivity directions for
  #                       :hexagon cells.  The default is :horizontal.  This
  #                       can only be used with :cell_shape :hexagon.
  #
  #   :padding - Accepts an integer that represents how many empty cells of
  #              padding should exist around occupied cells.  This effects
  #              large the board grows when resized.  The default is 1.
  #
  # The :omit paramter normally accepted by Board, is not valid for infinite
  # boards.
